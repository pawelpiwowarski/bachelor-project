This is the code that was used in my bachelor thesis.
It consists of notebooks which roughly follow the structure of the thesis.

The best trained model finetuned ViT with Data Augmentation achieved 86% accuracy on the 3-class 
pneumonia classification task, the finetuned model is publically avaliable to download [here](https://huggingface.co/pawlo2013/vit-pneumonia-x-ray_3_class), alongside with a desigated huggingface space for inference [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pawlo2013/pawlo2013-vit-pneumonia-x-ray_3_class).
